\usage{
estimate_weights(intervention_data, comparator_data, matching_vars)
}
\arguments{
\item{intervention_data}{A data frame containing individual patient data from the intervention study.}

\item{matching_vars}{A character vector giving the names of the covariates to use
in matching. These names must match the column names in intervention_data
and baseline_comparator.}

\item{baseline_comparator}{A data frame of average covariate values from the comparator study.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to optimisation functions such
as the method for maximum likelihood optimisation. The default is method =
"BFGS". Refer to \code{\link[stats]{optim}} for options.}
}
\value{
A list containing 2 objects. First, a data frame named intervention_wts_data including the intervention data
  with additional columns named WT (weights) and WT_RS (rescaled weights). Second, a vector of the matching variables names used.
